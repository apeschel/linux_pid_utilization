# linux_pid_utilization
Show the Utilization of Given PIDs in Linux

This project attempts to provide a method for showing how much time a process
spends sleeping. This is useful for helping with capacity planning; if a
process is spending most of its time sleeping, then it is unlikely that more of
that process are required to meet capacity requirements.
